Fatal Impact is about a zombie apocalypse survival game. The player will try to survive hordes
of zombies that intend to attack him. There will be items that he can pick up to help him survive:
melee weapons and long range weapons to fend off attacks; food and water to fend off hunger
and thirst. The player can explore the world and find a zombie boss to defeat and win the game.
Alternatively, the player will have to find a way to survive each day, while having the option to
